The XOR gate is very important in an adder. It acts as the logic of the adder and generates our sum.

### 3 - What is the largest number a two bit adder can handle? What happens when you go over?
The largest number a two bit adder can handle is 3. Anything larger, and the adder can not correctly store the sum, resulting in overflow.
